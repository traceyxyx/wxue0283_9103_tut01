What I really like in this artwork is the visual effect where lines split into different colored branches, then converge and recombine themselves into the original form. The harmonious color gradient adds a sense of visual richness to the orderly shapes or layout without making the original artwork (our group is probably doing the ‘Apple Tree’) appear chaotic. Moreover, this cycle creates a sense of rhythm, which I think would be perfect for audio-based animation. I might be able to combine this dynamic with the frequency or form the waveform of audio clips to create a harmonious sense of movement within the artwork.
